##Description

This is a project that was inspired by wanting to share music with my friends while I played video games with them. This application is written in C# and uses an open source audio and MIDI library called [NAudio](https://naudio.codeplex.com/).

This project was particularly challenging, as it involved figuring out a way to mix two input sources (my microphone and the music I was playing) into one source (what my friends where hearing) and at the same time, outputting the music to myself as well.

## Instructions on how to use

You'll need to download [Virtual Audio Cable](http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm) in order for this set up to work. Once you've installed virtual audio cable, you can follow the setup bellow.

- Set the **input** to your mic
- The **output** to your _Virtual Audio Cable (Line 1)_ 
- The **music output** to _Virtual Audio Cable (Line 1)_

For the application you are going to use to communicate with your freinds (Skype, Discord, etc.), select Line 1 as your input source.
